Project Description
The Idli Roundness Checker is a light-hearted web app that lets you scan your idli via webcam or photo upload and instantly get a roundness score with detailed calculations. It highlights the idli’s outline in red and even simulates a scanning animation.

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
Millions of idlis are eaten daily, but nobody really knows if they are perfectly round. How can we live in a world where idli geometry remains a mystery?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a browser-based Idli Roundness Detector that uses computer vision to scan your idli and rate it from 0% to 100% perfect roundness — because your breakfast deserves data-driven perfection.
